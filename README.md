# Space-Invader-PyGame
Space Invaders is a classic arcade video game created by Tomohiro Nishikado in 1978, and was one of the early games that played a major role in popularizing the gaming industry towards mainstream media. In the game, the player is a fixed shooter, who controls a spaceship by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The game also includes stationary green bunkers, that partially protect the player. These bunkers can be destroyed either by player or alien missiles. Many versions of the game also feature the aliens moving horizontally back and forth, while they advance to the bottom of the screen.
